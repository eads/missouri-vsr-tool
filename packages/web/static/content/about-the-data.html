<h1>About the data</h1>

<h2>What's in here</h2>

<p>Missouri requires police to report data on every traffic stop: who got stopped, why, what happened, and whether the car was searched. We've compiled that data from every department in the state.</p>

<p>This dataset includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stop volume</strong>: Total number of traffic stops by agency and year</li>
<li><strong>Demographics</strong>: Race, age, and gender of drivers stopped</li>
<li><strong>Stop reasons</strong>: Why drivers were pulled over (moving violations, equipment issues, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Outcomes</strong>: Whether stops resulted in warnings, citations, or arrests</li>
<li><strong>Searches</strong>: When and why vehicles were searched, and what was found</li>
<li><strong>Geographic data</strong>: Where stops occurred and which departments made them</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where it came from</h2>

<p>We got the raw data from the Missouri Attorney General and individual departments through public records requests. Then we cleaned it, standardized it, and made it searchable.</p>

<p>Missouri's Vehicle Stop Report (VSR) data is collected under state law requiring all law enforcement agencies to report detailed information about traffic stops. The Attorney General's office compiles annual reports, but the raw data can be difficult to access and analyze.</p>

<p>Our process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtained raw VSR data through public records requests</li>
<li>Standardized agency names and geographic boundaries</li>
<li>Cleaned and validated data for consistency</li>
<li>Added geocoding and demographic context</li>
<li>Built tools to make the data searchable and comparable</li>
</ol>

<p>You can search by county or city, explore individual agency profiles, compare metrics across departments, and download the underlying data for your own analysis.</p>

<h2>Data notes and limitations</h2>

<p>While this dataset is comprehensive, it has some limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data quality varies by agency and reporting period</li>
<li>Some small departments may have incomplete records</li>
<li>Population comparisons use Census estimates that may not reflect actual driving populations</li>
<li>Search and contraband data may be underreported in some jurisdictions</li>
<li>Agency boundaries and jurisdictions can overlap, making direct comparisons complex</li>
</ul>
